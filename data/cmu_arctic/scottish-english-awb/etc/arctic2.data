( arctic_b0100 "There was one chance, and only one, of saving Jeanne." )
( arctic_b0101 "You're a devil for fighting, and will surely win." )
( arctic_b0102 "I'll only be in the way." )
( arctic_b0103 "He lifted his eyes, and a strange cry burst from his lips." )

( arctic_b0105 "I know that you are in charge there, and Jeanne knows." )
( arctic_b0106 "For a full minute the two men stared into each other's face." )

( arctic_b0116 "I have hunted along this ridge, replied Philip." )
( arctic_b0117 "That's Thorpe's, said the young engineer." )
( arctic_b0118 "We saw your light, and thought you wouldn't mind a call." )
( arctic_b0119 "Billinger may arrive in time." )
( arctic_b0120 "There's the hitch, replied Thorpe, rolling a cigarette." )
( arctic_b0121 "I want my men to work by themselves." )

( arctic_b0126 "Blood was oozing slowly from the wounded man's right breast." )
( arctic_b0127 "He destroyed everything that had belonged to the woman." )
( arctic_b0128 "Philip bent low over Pierre." )
( arctic_b0129 "Did Thorpe go to see any one in Churchill." )
( arctic_b0130 "She saw the answer in his face." )
( arctic_b0131 "Thorpe and his men were to destroy this camp, and kill you." )
( arctic_b0132 "There is no need of further detail, now--for you can understand." )
( arctic_b0133 "There followed a roar that shook the earth." )
( arctic_b0134 "Blind with rage, he darted in." )
( arctic_b0135 "In it was the joy of life." )
( arctic_b0136 "Swiftly his eyes measured the situation." )
( arctic_b0137 "But this little defect did not worry him." )
( arctic_b0138 "And then, steadily, he began to chew." )
( arctic_b0139 "Together they ate the rabbit." )
( arctic_b0140 "They edged nearer, and stood shoulder to shoulder facing their world." )
( arctic_b0141 "It was beating and waiting in the ambush of those black pits." )
( arctic_b0142 "Something vastly more thrilling had come into it now." )
( arctic_b0143 "It took him half an hour to reach the edge of it." )
( arctic_b0144 "But there was no longer the mother-yearning in his heart." )
( arctic_b0145 "Besides, had he not whipped the big owl in the forest." )
( arctic_b0146 "After all, it was simply a mistake in judgment." )
( arctic_b0147 "Had it struck squarely it would have killed him." )
( arctic_b0148 "The Indian even poked his stick into the thick ground spruce." )
( arctic_b0149 "Pebbles and dirt flew along with hair and fur." )
( arctic_b0150 "And he was filled with a strange and foreboding fear." )
( arctic_b0151 "It was steel, a fisher trap." )
( arctic_b0152 "OW, a wild dog, he growled." )
( arctic_b0153 "He was a pariah; a wanderer without a friend or a home." )
( arctic_b0154 "That is the strange part of it." )
( arctic_b0155 "His freshly caught furs he flung to the floor." )
( arctic_b0156 "For that reason Le Beau had chosen him to fight the big fight." )
( arctic_b0157 "In the crib the baby sat up and began to prattle." )
( arctic_b0158 "She obeyed, shrinking back with the baby in her arms." )
( arctic_b0159 "His teeth shut with a last click." )
( arctic_b0160 "It was over when he made his way through the ring of spectators." )
( arctic_b0161 "In a flash he was on his feet, facing him." )
( arctic_b0162 "He thought he saw a shudder pass through the Factor's shoulders." )
( arctic_b0163 "The moon had already begun its westward decline." )
( arctic_b0164 "They laughed like two happy children." )
( arctic_b0165 "He pulled, and the log crashed down to break his back." )
