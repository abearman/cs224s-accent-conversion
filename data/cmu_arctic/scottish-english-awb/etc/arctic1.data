( arctic_a0005 "Will we ever forget it." )
( arctic_a0006 "God bless 'em, I hope I'll go on seeing them forever." )
( arctic_a0007 "And you always want to see it in the superlative degree." )
( arctic_a0008 "Gad, your letter came just in time." )
( arctic_a0009 "He turned sharply, and faced Gregson across the table." )
( arctic_a0010 "I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game." )
( arctic_a0011 "If I ever needed a fighter in my life I need one now." )
( arctic_a0012 "Gregson shoved back his chair and rose to his feet." )
( arctic_a0013 "He was a head shorter than his companion, of almost delicate physique." )
( arctic_a0014 "Now you're coming down to business, Phil, he exclaimed." )
( arctic_a0015 "It's the aurora borealis." )
( arctic_a0016 "There's Fort Churchill, a rifle-shot beyond the ridge, asleep." )
( arctic_a0017 "From that moment his friendship for Belize turns to hatred and jealousy." )
( arctic_a0018 "There was a change now." )
( arctic_a0019 "I followed the line of the proposed railroad, looking for chances." )

( arctic_a0021 "It fairly clubbed me into recognizing it." )
( arctic_a0022 "Hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition." )
( arctic_a0023 "A combination of Canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges." )

( arctic_a0067 "Surely I will excuse you, she cried." )
( arctic_a0068 "In a flash Philip followed its direction." )
( arctic_a0069 "It was his intention to return to Eileen and her father." )

( arctic_a0071 "What was the object of your little sensation." )
( arctic_a0072 "But who was Eileen's double." )
( arctic_a0073 "The promoter's eyes were heavy, with little puffy bags under them." )

( arctic_a0076 "There has been a change, she interrupted him." )
( arctic_a0077 "The gray eyes faltered; the flush deepened." )
( arctic_a0078 "It is the fire, partly, she said." )
( arctic_a0080 "Then, and at supper, he tried to fathom her." )
( arctic_a0081 "It was a large canoe." )
( arctic_a0082 "What if Jeanne failed him." )
( arctic_a0083 "What if she did not come to the rock." )
( arctic_a0084 "His face was streaming with blood." )
( arctic_a0085 "A shadow was creeping over Pierre's eyes." )

( arctic_a0092 "The singing voice approached rapidly." )
( arctic_a0093 "His blood grew hot with rage at the thought." )
( arctic_a0094 "He went down in mid-stream, searching the shadows of both shores." )
( arctic_a0095 "For a full minute he crouched and listened." )
( arctic_a0096 "He had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire." )
( arctic_a0097 "A big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision." )
( arctic_a0098 "Perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest." )
( arctic_a0099 "Then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow." )
( arctic_a0100 "Shall I carry you." )
( arctic_a0101 "A maddening joy pounded in his brain." )
( arctic_a0102 "You must sleep, he urged." )
( arctic_a0103 "You, you would not--keep the truth from me." )
( arctic_a0104 "He will follow us soon." )
( arctic_a0105 "But there came no promise from the bow of the canoe." )
( arctic_a0106 "She was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child." )
( arctic_a0107 "Only, it is so wonderful, so almost IMPOSSIBLE to believe." )
( arctic_a0108 "The emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob." )
( arctic_a0109 "If you only could know how I thank you." )
( arctic_a0110 "He waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself." )
( arctic_a0111 "Do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you." )
( arctic_a0112 "Much, replied Jeanne, as tersely." )
( arctic_a0113 "Instead, he joined her; and they ate like two hungry children." )
( arctic_a0114 "He was wounded in the arm." )
( arctic_a0115 "I suppose you picked that lingo up among the Indians." )
( arctic_a0116 "Her words sent a strange chill through Philip." )
( arctic_a0117 "He had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him." )
( arctic_a0118 "Was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin." )
( arctic_a0119 "She added, with genuine sympathy in her face and voice:" )
( arctic_a0120 "Pierre obeys me when we are together." )
( arctic_a0121 "Jeanne was turning the bow shoreward." )
( arctic_a0122 "My right foot feels like that of a Chinese debutante." )
( arctic_a0123 "They ate dinner at the fifth, and rested for two hours." )
( arctic_a0124 "Two years ago I gave up civilization for this." )
( arctic_a0125 "She had died from cold and starvation." )
( arctic_a0126 "It was Jeanne singing softly over beyond the rocks." )
( arctic_a0127 "He was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself." )
( arctic_a0128 "Each day she became a more vital part of him." )
( arctic_a0129 "It was a temptation, but he resisted it." )
( arctic_a0130 "This one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born." )
( arctic_a0131 "Her face was against his breast." )
( arctic_a0132 "She was his now, forever." )
( arctic_a0133 "Providence had delivered him through the maelstrom." )
( arctic_a0134 "A cry of joy burst from Philip's lips." )
( arctic_a0135 "Philip began to feel that he had foolishly overestimated his strength." )
( arctic_a0136 "He obeyed the pressure of her hand." )
( arctic_a0137 "I am going to surprise father, and you will go with Pierre." )
( arctic_a0138 "About him, everywhere, were the evidences of luxury and of age." )
( arctic_a0139 "Then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure." )
( arctic_a0140 "In the picture he saw each moment a greater resemblance to Jeanne." )
( arctic_a0141 "He told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes." )
( arctic_a0142 "Accept a father's blessing, and with it, this." )
( arctic_a0143 "It seems like a strange pointing of the hand of God." )
( arctic_a0144 "Such things had occurred before, he told Philip." )
( arctic_a0145 "Ah, I had forgotten, he exclaimed." )
( arctic_a0146 "But there was something even more startling than this resemblance." )
( arctic_a0147 "I have to be careful of them, as they tear very easily." )
( arctic_a0148 "Of course, that is uninteresting, she continued." )
( arctic_a0149 "A moment before he was intoxicated by a joy that was almost madness." )
( arctic_a0150 "Now these things had been struck dead within him." )
( arctic_a0151 "For an instant he saw Pierre drawn like a silhouette against the sky." )
( arctic_a0152 "Good-by, Pierre, he shouted." )
( arctic_a0153 "And MacDougall was beyond the trail, with three weeks to spare." )
( arctic_a0154 "Philip thrust himself against it and entered." )
( arctic_a0155 "MacDougall tapped his forehead suspiciously with a stubby forefinger." )
( arctic_a0156 "He was smooth-shaven, and his hair and eyes were black." )
( arctic_a0157 "Won't you draw up, gentlemen." )
( arctic_a0158 "A strange fire burned in his eyes when Thorpe turned." )
( arctic_a0159 "He had worshiped her, as Dante might have worshiped Beatrice." )
( arctic_a0160 "Does that look good." )
( arctic_a0161 "They look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life." )
( arctic_a0162 "You want to go over and see his gang throw dirt." )
( arctic_a0163 "Take away their foreman and they wouldn't be worth their grub." )
( arctic_a0164 "That's the sub-foreman, explained Thorpe." )
( arctic_a0165 "Philip made no effort to follow." )
( arctic_a0166 "He came first a year ago, and revealed himself to Jeanne." )
( arctic_a0167 "They are to attack your camp tomorrow night." )
( arctic_a0168 "Two days ago Jeanne learned where her father's men were hiding." )
( arctic_a0169 "I was near the cabin, and saw you." )
( arctic_a0170 "Low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting." )
( arctic_a0171 "Suddenly Jeanne stopped for an instant." )
( arctic_a0172 "There was none of the joy of meeting in his face." )
( arctic_a0173 "And when you come back in a few days, bring Eileen." )
( arctic_a0174 "Gregson had left the outer door slightly ajar." )
( arctic_a0175 "The date was nearly eighteen years old." )
( arctic_a0176 "They were the presage of storm." )
( arctic_a0177 "Down there the earth was already swelling with life." )
( arctic_a0178 "For the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap." )
( arctic_a0179 "She had been thoroughly and efficiently mauled." )
( arctic_a0180 "Every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated." )
( arctic_a0181 "Tomorrow I'm going after that bear, he said." )
( arctic_a0182 "If not, let's say our prayers and go to bed." )
( arctic_a0183 "So cheer up, and give us your paw." )
( arctic_a0184 "This time he did not yap for mercy." )
( arctic_a0185 "And the air was growing chilly." )
( arctic_a0186 "Don't you see., I'm chewing this thing in two." )
( arctic_a0187 "The questions may have come vaguely in his mind." )
( arctic_a0188 "Like a flash he launched himself into the feathered mass of the owl." )
( arctic_a0189 "Ahead of them they saw a glimmer of sunshine." )
( arctic_a0190 "Two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass." )
( arctic_a0191 "The big-eyed, clucking moose-birds were most annoying." )
( arctic_a0192 "Next to them the Canada jays were most persistent." )
( arctic_a0193 "For a time the exciting thrill of his adventure was gone." )
( arctic_a0194 "He did not rush in." )
( arctic_a0195 "It was edged with ice." )
( arctic_a0196 "He drank of the water cautiously." )
( arctic_a0197 "But a strange thing happened." )
( arctic_a0198 "He began to follow the footprints of the dog." )
( arctic_a0199 "Such a dog the wise driver kills, or turns loose." )
( arctic_a0200 "Sometimes her dreams were filled with visions." )
( arctic_a0201 "Thus had the raw wilderness prepared him for this day." )
( arctic_a0202 "He leapt again, and the club caught him once more." )
( arctic_a0203 "he cried, and swung the club wildly." )
( arctic_a0204 "She turned, fearing that Jacques might see what was in her face." )
( arctic_a0205 "They were following the shore of a lake." )
( arctic_a0206 "The wolf-dog thrust his gaunt muzzle toward him." )
( arctic_a0207 "From now on we're pals." )
( arctic_a0208 "He says he bought him of Jacques Le Beau." )
( arctic_a0209 "How much was it." )
( arctic_a0210 "Youth had come back to her, freed from the yoke of oppression." )
( arctic_a0211 "It was not a large lake, and almost round." )
( arctic_a0212 "Its diameter was not more than two hundred yards." )
( arctic_a0213 "It drowned all sound that brute agony and death may have made." )
( arctic_a0214 "Fresh cases, still able to walk, they clustered about the spokesman." )
( arctic_a0215 "Between him and the beach was the cane-grass fence of the compound." )
( arctic_a0216 "Besides, he was paid one case of tobacco per head." )
( arctic_a0217 "They die out of spite." )
( arctic_a0218 "The other felt a sudden wave of irritation rush through him." )
( arctic_a0219 "Oppressive as the heat had been, it was now even more oppressive." )
( arctic_a0220 "The ringing of the big bell aroused him." )
( arctic_a0221 "At first he puzzled over something untoward he was sure had happened." )
( arctic_a0222 "A dead man is of no use on a plantation." )
( arctic_a0223 "I don't know why you're here at all." )
( arctic_a0224 "What part of the United States is your home." )
( arctic_a0225 "My, I'm almost homesick for it already." )
( arctic_a0226 "She nodded, and her eyes grew soft and moist." )
( arctic_a0227 "I was brought up the way most girls in Hawaii are brought up." )
( arctic_a0228 "That came before my A B C's." )
( arctic_a0229 "It was the same way with our revolvers and rifles." )
