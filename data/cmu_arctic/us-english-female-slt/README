INSTALLING AS A FESTIVAL VOICE
==============================

As distributed this voice may be used as a festival clunits voice with
versions 1.4.2 and 1.4.3 of Festival (which is available from)

    http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/ or
    http://www.festvox.org/festival/

You can run the voice "in place" or link it into your festival
installation.  

To run "in place" from the database directory

    festival festvox/cmu_us_slt_arctic_clunits.scm
    ...
    festival> (voice_cmu_us_slt_arctic_clunits)
    ...
    festival> (SayText "This is a short introduction ...")

Or to install as voice in your Festival installation it must appear
as a subdirectory of a subdirectory of a directory listed in the 
Festival variable voice-path.  For standard installations you can
create the following directory if it doesn't exist

    /...WHATEVER.../festival/lib/voices/us/

For RPM installed systems (such as RedHat) this would be

    /usr/share/festival/voices/us/

In that directory create a symbolic link to the arctic voice as in

    ln -s /usr/local/arctic/cmu_us_slt_arctic cmu_us_slt_arctic_clunits

Note the name in the us/ directory must be the name of the voice.

This should allow festival to find the voice automatically thus

    festival
    ...
    festival> (voice_cmu_us_slt_arctic_clunits)
    ...
    festival> (SayText "This is a short introduction ...")
